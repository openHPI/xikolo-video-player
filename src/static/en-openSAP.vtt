00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:15.099 A:middle
Welcome to the openSAP course on Enterprise
Machine Learning.

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100 A:middle
My name is Markus Noga.

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.466 A:middle
My Machine Learning team is part of SAP's
Innovation Center Network.

4
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:25.899 A:middle
And we're on a mission to make all enterprise
applications intelligent.

5
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.600 A:middle
This first installment of the course will help you
understand recent advances in machine learning.

6
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.900 A:middle
It will give you an overview of what this means for
enterprise computing and for knowledge work in
general.

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.366 A:middle
And it will help you understand the module
structure so you can navigate through the rest of
the course more effectively.

8
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:50.799 A:middle
Machine learning is about computers learning
from data rather than being explicitly
programmed.

9
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.733 A:middle
And this makes software progressively more
intelligent.

10
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.766 A:middle
Examples of this surround us in our daily lives.

11
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.566 A:middle
Whether it's the intelligent assistants on our
smartphones,

12
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.132 A:middle
whether it's the smart thermostats in our homes,

13
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.399 A:middle
or whether it's the self-driving cars all over the
press,

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.433 A:middle
we're seeing evidence of computers becoming
more intelligent.

15
00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:12.566 A:middle
And this is possible now because of advances in
machine learning.

16
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.699 A:middle
Computers are dealing with unstructured
information,

17
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.433 A:middle
natural-language text, images, and videos

18
00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:24.133 A:middle
rather than the neat rows and tables of structured
information that were the computers' domain
before.

19
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:29.299 A:middle
And computers are learning complex functions
on this unstructured data from examples

20
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.366 A:middle
rather than with explicit programming.

21
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.366 A:middle
One example of this is computer vision.

22
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.732 A:middle
When I started studying computer science in the
late nineties,

23
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:44.999 A:middle
any two-year-old was better at looking at an
image and saying what it's about.

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.733 A:middle
Today, we can toss an image into a search box or
a dialog

25
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:56.233 A:middle
and we will readily see labels and descriptions,
like people or dog, coming up.

26
00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:01.499 A:middle
And for the first time since late 2015, computers
are actually better than humans at this

27
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.933 A:middle
as measured on popular benchmarks.

28
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:13.599 A:middle
So progressively, unstructured information is
becoming available for us to do interesting things
with also in an enterprise context.

29
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.933 A:middle
This is because we're not trying to hand-code or
hard-code decision rules about what to do:

30
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:26.533 A:middle
If the left upper pixel of the image is red, do this.
Otherwise, do that.

31
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:32.966 A:middle
It's unfeasible to get to a good image-processing
algorithm with hand-coded rules like that.

32
00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:38.732 A:middle
Instead, what we do is throw lots of examples at
the machine and have them learn fuzzy decision
functions

33
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:44.399 A:middle
from that data with an appropriate training
regimen.

34
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.600 A:middle
This has huge potential.

35
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.833 A:middle
Machine learning for the enterprise is projected to
grow at over 50% year over year

36
00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:56.233 A:middle
towards a $4 billion market by 2020.

37
00:02:56.233 --> 00:03:00.699 A:middle
This has the potential to transform knowledge
work as we know it.

38
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700 A:middle
Already today in blue collar work, humans and
machines are working together on production

39
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.300 A:middle
and assembly lines and together doing better
than each could be doing individually.

40
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300 A:middle
We will see the same in knowledge work with
repetitive, high-volume,

41
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.300 A:middle
high-frequency tasks increasingly becoming
automated and humans focusing on value-added
tasks.

42
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.700 A:middle
And together, humans and machines doing even
better than before.

43
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700 A:middle
This also enables us to do what has been
hitherto impossible.

44
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.233 A:middle
Think of scenarios like taking out your mobile
phone, taking a picture of a part,

45
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:39.499 A:middle
and being able to reorder immediately via the
Ariba network at the click of a button.

46
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.100 A:middle
These kinds of scenarios would not be possible
without machine learning.

47
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.366 A:middle
Why are we at an inflection point for machine
learning today?

48
00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:51.199 A:middle
It's because of three main factors:

49
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500 A:middle
Number one, we have the data.

50
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.833 A:middle
Big Data.

51
00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:59.833 A:middle
Volumes that were unattainable even a couple of
years ago allow us to train much larger

52
00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:03.199 A:middle
networks with many more variables.

53
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.366 A:middle
Big Compute.

54
00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:09.966 A:middle
Substantial improvements in the amount of
computational horsepower available to us,

55
00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:14.966 A:middle
especially on graphics cards or so-called GPUs,
enable us to actually crunch

56
00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:19.066 A:middle
and process the massive amounts of sample
data and training sets.

57
00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:25.132 A:middle
Number three â€“ improvements in machine learning algorithms, especially in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

58
00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:29.233 A:middle
You will learn about these in the following
installments of the course.

59
00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:34.799 A:middle
Taken together, this creates an inflection point
also for enterprise computing

60
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.800 A:middle
as machine learning enables us to leverage the
wealth of information

61
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.800 A:middle
that the digital transformation provides to us and to bring together

62
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.500 A:middle
the data assets of different enterprises in clouds
and on business networks

63
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.500 A:middle
creating even larger pools of information to learn
from.

64
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.000 A:middle
This course on Enterprise Machine Learning is
organized in seven modules.

65
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.600 A:middle
The next session will help you understand basic
concepts behind machine learning

66
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.866 A:middle
so that deep learning and reinforcement learning
are terms that have meaning to you.

67
00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:17.066 A:middle
The third section will help you understand how to
take an arbitrary business challenge

68
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:23.932 A:middle
and to turn that into a tractable machine learning
problem that machine learning engineers can
actually work on

69
00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.866 A:middle
The fourth installment will help you understand
how machine learning fits into corporate

70
00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:33.132 A:middle
computing landscapes and how to interface with
existing applications.

71
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:39.933 A:middle
And Units 5 and 6 of this course provide end-to-
end examples of taking a use case

72
00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.399 A:middle
and turning that into a concrete machine learning
solution.

73
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.300 A:middle
Section 7 wraps up with key takeaways and next
steps, as well as future learning resources.
